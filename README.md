## Project Description

For my CS50 final project, I set out to enhance my knowledge of JavaScript, an area where I had limited experience. I chose to create a game as a practical way to deepen my understanding of JavaScript, opting for Wordle due to its coding complexity.

### Game Overview

The objective of the game is for the user to discover the five-letter word, which serves as the answer. Throughout the game, the user makes attempts to solve the puzzle, receiving hints in the form of colored letters (yellow or green). Upon successfully solving the puzzle, the answer section on the page turns green, and the user is provided with a refresh button to start a new game.

### Gameplay Features

- **Hint System:** Colored letters (yellow or green) provide clues to the user.
- **Victory Display:** When the user correctly solves the puzzle, the answer section turns green.
- **Error Handling:** In case of an invalid word entry, the game displays an error message, prompting the user to start a new game.

### Learning Focus

This project served as a valuable learning experience in JavaScript, allowing me to tackle real-world coding challenges and improve my skills. The complexity of Wordle provided an excellent opportunity to delve deeper into the language.

## How to Play

1. Attempt to guess the five-letter word.
2. Receive hints through colored letters.
3. Successfully solve the puzzle to turn the answer section green.
4. In case of an invalid word, follow the on-screen instructions to start a new game.
